   <h1>Stumble Guys</h1>
   <p>Stumble Guys: Multiplayer Royale is a massively multiplayer battle royale game developed by Kitka Games. The game is about 32 players competing on different maps such as races or survival where they must qualify and not lose to reach the next round and be finalists to win the game by winning a crown. The game was released on Google Play on 24 September 2020 as a free-to-play game, later on 7 February 2021 a beta version released for iOS was released after publishing the official trailer for iOS. 5 days later, the game was fully released on Apple Store. On 7 October 2021 the game was released on Steam along with a live stream on the official YouTube account where the game developer appeared waiting for the game to arrive on Steam. The game received a lot of support for being a free-to-play version of the battle royale game Fall Guys, though this also came under criticism for being a poor copy and having pay-to-win features.</p>
